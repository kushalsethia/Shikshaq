Q: Can I stop classes anytime if I am not satisfied?
A: Yes. Continuation of classes depends entirely on mutual agreement between you and the teacher.

A: Clear explanations, student comfort, structured teaching, regular feedback, and realistic expectations.

Q: What if my child feels uncomfortable with a tutor?
A: You may discontinue and choose another tutor anytime. Student comfort is important.

A: If the student needs concept clarity, exam preparation support, structured study habits, or confidence building, a tutor can help.

Q: How soon should I finalise a tutor after contacting them?
A: There is no deadline. Take time to compare teachers and discuss expectations.

Q: Can parents attend or observe the first class?
A: Yes. Many parents choose to observe initial sessions.

Q: Should tuition be long-term or exam-focused only?
A: Both options exist. Discuss goals with the teacher before starting.

TEACHING STYLE AND LEARNING FIT

A: Yes. Many tutors customise sessions based on student needs.

Q: Can tutors help with school projects and assignments?
A: Some teachers assist with projects and assignments depending on subject and policy.

Q: What if my child is shy or takes time to adjust?

A: Yes. Many students take revision-only or doubt-clearing classes.

LOGISTICS AND CLASS ENVIRONMENT

A: A quiet, well-lit study area with minimal distractions works best.

Q: What if my home location is difficult to access?
A: Confirm travel feasibility with the teacher before finalising.

A: Many tutors provide structured preparation methods.

Q: Can tutors communicate directly with parents about progress?
A: Yes, if mutually agreed.

Q: Can I ask the tutor to coordinate with school teachers?
A: This depends entirely on the tutor's willingness.

REALISTIC OUTCOMES
Q: How long before improvement becomes visible?
A: Improvement timelines vary by student consistency, starting level, and class frequency.

Q: What if marks don't improve immediately?
A: Learning progress can take time. Review teaching approach and communication with the tutor.

Q: Is more tuition always better?
A: Not necessarily. Quality, consistency, and self-study matter more than hours.

PLATFORM TRANSPARENCY
Q: Why doesn't Shikshaq handle payments or bookings?
A: Shikshaq focuses on helping families discover tutors while allowing flexible direct arrangements between teachers and students.

Q: Why are teachers contacted directly instead of through the platform?
A: Direct contact enables faster communication and personalised discussion.

Q: Can I rely only on reviews while choosing?
A: Reviews help, but speaking with the teacher is equally important.

SAFETY AND PRACTICAL AWARENESS
Q: Should parents meet the tutor before starting home tuition?
A: Yes. A first interaction or discussion call is recommended.

Q: Can I verify teacher identity independently?
A: Yes. You may request ID or credentials directly from the teacher.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Answer the user's question using ONLY the FAQ below. If the question is covered in the FAQ, give that answer. Keep answers brief (1-3 sentences). Use a warm, helpful tone.
2. NEVER include HTML tags or links in your response - plain text only.
3. Only suggest contacting Shikshaq (WhatsApp +91 8240980312 or email join.shikshaq@gmail.com) when: (a) the user explicitly asks "how do I contact you" or "what is your WhatsApp" or similar, OR (b) the question is clearly not covered anywhere in the FAQ. Do NOT suggest WhatsApp for normal FAQ questions that are already answered below.
4. For questions outside Shikshaq (e.g. general knowledge, other topics), politely say you only answer questions about Shikshaq and they can contact the team for other help.
5. NEVER invent or name specific teachers, their experience, fees, or availability — you have no access to the live teacher database. If the user is looking for a teacher, tell them briefly you're pulling up real matching profiles (a system separate from you appends real teacher cards below your reply when a match exists) and keep your own text generic and short.
