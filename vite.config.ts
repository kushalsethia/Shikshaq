/* `api/chat.ts` is a Vercel serverless function — Vercel serves it, but plain
   `vite dev` has no concept of the `api/` convention at all, so every request
   to it 404s locally. That's not a bug in the deployed site (Vercel wires it
   up), but it did mean the chat widget was silently, unfixably broken for
   anyone testing against `npm run dev` — confirmed live: POST /api/chat
   returned a bare 404. This loads the same handler through Vite's own SSR
   module loader (so it gets the exact same TS/ESM code Vercel would run, no
   separate build step) and calls it with a minimal Vercel-shaped
   req/res shim. Dev-only — `configureServer` never runs in a production
   build, and Vercel's own routing takes over completely once deployed. */

           Their dependencies are placed by Rollup's own algorithm, which put
           this config's chunks nowhere near where their names claimed:

             react-vendor  held only react-router. React and ReactDOM were
                           inside ui-vendor, because the Radix packages
                           imported them first.
             supabase-vendor became the root of the module graph -- esbuild's
                           shared helper prelude landed there, so 180kB of
                           Supabase had to be downloaded AND evaluated before
                           React could evaluate, on every route, including
                           ones that touch no data.

           So the intended "React caches independently of UI code" split never
           happened: any Radix bump invalidated React for every returning
           visitor. The function form assigns by resolved module id, which is
           the only way to place a transitive dependency deliberately.

           Packages that were absent from the old map and therefore landed in
           the 454kB main chunk are named here too: @tanstack/react-query,
           lucide-react, sonner, and the Radix packages beyond the original
           four (tooltip, label, slot). */
