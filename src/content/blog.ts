/**
 * The blog's article set.
 *
 * Every article here is built from BLOG_SUBJECTS, which scripts/generate-blog-
 * stats.ts counts out of the real question bank -- one entry per subject the
 * bank actually covers. That is the whole editorial position: there is no
 * shortage of pages telling a student that a topic is important, and none of
 * them have counted how many marks it actually carried across real Kolkata
 * papers. This has, for however many subjects the bank holds real data for.
 *
 * Per-subject article shape is NOT uniform, because the underlying data
 * isn't: a subject only gets a topic ranking and per-topic pages when its
 * bank actually carries usable topic-level data (Mathematics, History &
 * Civics, English today). Economics carries exam-structure data (marks,
 * exam types) but no topic field at all, so it gets the "how schools set
 * their papers" article and nothing pretending to rank topics that were
 * never counted. See generate-blog-stats.ts for exactly what each subject's
 * bank does and doesn't carry.
 *
 * Mathematics' three slugs are UNCHANGED from before this file went multi-
 * subject -- they are live, indexed URLs, and changing them would break
 * every existing link and search result pointed at them. New subjects mint
 * their own distinct slug shapes rather than reusing that one.
 *
 * House style (CLAUDE.md): no em or en dashes anywhere in reader-facing copy.
