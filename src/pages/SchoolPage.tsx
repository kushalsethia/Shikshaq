/* S16 — the school page.

 * PastPapers has by-school rows that go nowhere". They were buttons with no
 * href, so a school was a dead end — you could read that La Martiniere has four
 * papers and had no way to open them.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from the paper rows themselves. There is no
 * schools table, so the summary line, the facets and the year range are all
 * computed from what has actually been uploaded, and a school with no papers
 * cannot exist as a page at all.
 *
 * Handoff 09g (SP-001..SP-004) rebuilds this as a BentoStack, matching the
 * rest of the already-migrated papers funnel (PastPapers.tsx, SchoolsPage.tsx)
 * — same indigo header, same PP-010 school-row visual language for the
 * canonical patterns it reuses.
