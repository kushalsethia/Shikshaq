/**
 * The three figures the site describes itself with: verified teachers,
 * published papers, and the number of schools those papers came from.
 *
 * There are four hand-rolled copies of this query in the codebase already
 * (Navbar, ProductTour, About, papers-live-announcement), each with its own
 * caching, its own error handling and its own idea of which table to count.
 * This is the canonical one. New callers use it; the existing four can be
 * retired onto it one at a time.
 *
 * A count that does not arrive stays `null` and its caller draws nothing,
 * rather than rendering a zero or a plausible-looking figure. That is the
 * site's standing rule for numbers and the reason this returns nulls instead
 * of defaulting to 0.
