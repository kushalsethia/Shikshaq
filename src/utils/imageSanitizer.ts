/**
 * Validate and sanitize image URL to prevent XSS attacks
 * This function ensures user input is properly sanitized before being used in DOM
 *
 * This used to run DOMPurify.sanitize() over the URL string first. That was
 * doing no security work here and a lot of CPU work: DOMPurify allocates and
 * parses a DOM document per call, and validateImageSrc below is invoked inline
 * in JSX (TeacherCard, the Index rails, review cards), so a 24-card grid paid
 * for 24+ document allocations on every render pass.
 *
 * It was not protecting anything. The value is bound to an <img src>, never to
 * innerHTML, so HTML-entity stripping is irrelevant; what actually makes this
 * safe is the protocol allowlist plus rebuilding the string from a parsed URL,
 * both of which are below and unchanged. `new URL()` is stricter than the old
 * path too, since it rejects anything it cannot parse rather than handing a
 * mangled string onward.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- sizing */

/**
 * The same validated URL, asking the CDN for the size actually being painted.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Teacher photos are served at their upload resolution. One
 * of them is **1.81 MB**, and Browse loads up to 500 teachers, into cards
 * about 150px wide and avatar circles of 30px. Measured against the live CDN:
 *
 *   original                1,811,039 bytes
 *   w_400,q_auto,f_auto        31,961 bytes   (98.2% smaller)
 *   w_200,q_auto,f_auto        10,728 bytes
 *   w_96,q_auto,f_auto          3,290 bytes
 *
 * `q_auto` lets Cloudinary pick the quality it can get away with per image,
 * and `f_auto` serves WebP or AVIF to browsers that accept it and the original
 * format to those that do not.
 *
 * ONLY CLOUDINARY, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. The 148 teacher photos are
 * split across hosts: 64 on Cloudinary, 79 on Supabase storage, 2 elsewhere.
 * Supabase's own `/render/image/` transform endpoint answers **403** on this
 * project -- it is plan-gated and this plan does not have it, verified rather
 * than assumed -- so those 79 cannot be resized at the edge at all and are
 * passed through untouched. Anything that is not a recognised Cloudinary
 * upload URL is returned exactly as `validateImageSrc` produced it.
 *
 * SANITISATION STILL RUNS FIRST. This wraps `validateImageSrc` rather than
 * replacing it, so the protocol allowlist and blob-URL checks happen before
 * any rewriting, and a URL that fails them returns '' without ever reaching
 * the transform. A hostile URL cannot smuggle itself through by looking like
 * a Cloudinary path.
