 * already had this exact query as a signed-in-only side rail for prev/next
 * navigation; this is the same data, unrelated to that gate — paper titles
 * and years are already public metadata (anon-readable on both bank_papers
 * and papers), so there's no reason this discovery section should be
 * signed-in only too. Each reader fetches its own list (different source
 * table, same shape) and passes it in here.
