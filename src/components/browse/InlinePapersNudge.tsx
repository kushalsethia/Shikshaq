/* A papers card, sitting in the teacher results.
 *
 * Someone comparing Class 10 ICSE Maths teachers is the single most likely
 * person on the site to want Class 10 ICSE Maths papers, and until now the only
 * route between the two surfaces was a promo below the fold on subject pages
 * and the nav. This puts one card in the flow of the thing they are already
 * reading.
 *
 * Four rules keep it a nudge rather than an ad:
 *
 *   1. It carries the READER'S OWN filters through. Subject, class and board
 *      are matched against the bank and passed to the papers surface, so the
 *      handoff lands pre-filtered on what they were already looking at.
 *   2. When no filter is applied at all, it falls back to the intent index
 *      (lib/intent) instead of a generic "619 past papers" line — but only
 *      the FACET, never the count and never below the route's earned
 *      adaptation level (experience.level, the same gate every other
 *      adaptive surface reads). Explicit still beats inferred: the moment a
 *      reader touches a real filter, that overrides whatever intent guessed.
 *   3. It states a real count, computed from the same index the papers surface
 *      renders from. Never a rounded or fabricated figure.
 *   4. It renders NOTHING when the count is zero. The bank covers three
 *      subjects; a reader browsing Physics or Bengali teachers must not be
 *      offered a link to an empty results page. That is the whole reason this
 *      counts before it draws.
