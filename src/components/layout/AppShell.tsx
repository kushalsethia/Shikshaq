/* AppShell — the single place shell config for every route is decided.

   pages.md §"Shell config for every route": "three decisions, made in
   AppShell, never in the page: control block ..., pre-footer block (B1-B4),
   nav (bottom tabs on mobile, top bar on desktop, always both, never
   per-page)." Before this component existed, ~28 page files each hand
   assembled their own Footer/PreFooter/BottomNav combination — some correct,
   some missing a pre-footer entirely, some duplicating a <Footer/> across
   every loading/error/success branch. AppShell is mounted once, above
   <Routes>, so none of that per-branch duplication is possible any more:
   whichever branch a page returns, the chrome around it is the same.

   Nav (TopBar + Navbar, the desktop bar and the mobile sticky bar + sheet)
   and BottomNav were already mounted once globally in App.tsx before this
   change — that part of "never per-page" already held. What moves here is
   Footer + PreFooter + BottomNavSpacer, which used to live inside every page.

   The auth flow, the admin console, and the paper reader are chromeless —
   no TopBar/Navbar/BottomNav/Footer/PreFooter at all, full-bleed screens with
   their own header. Admin additionally gets its own rail/toolbar shell
   (pages.md §15, not built yet) rather than this consumer AppShell. */

     The effect version raced the pages it was meant to serve: React runs
     child effects before parent effects, so on a route whose component mounts
     in the same commit as AppShell, the page called setChrome({preFooter:
     'none'}) and this reset immediately wiped it — permanently, since neither
     effect re-runs until the next navigation. Every route survived it by
     accident of being `lazy` (mounting a commit later, after the reset), and
     `/` — the one eager import in App.tsx — did not. That is why Home alone
     rendered the B1 pre-footer it had explicitly opted out of.
