/* Redesign P6 (components.md §1, design.md §2.7).

   Anatomy, in order:
     line 1 (display)
     [ordinal 01–04]  line 2 (display)
     one support sentence (secondary body)

   The ordinals ARE the page's reading order — if sections move, renumber them.
   They are decorative as far as assistive tech is concerned (the heading text
   carries the meaning), so the ordinal is aria-hidden.

   Sizing: 27px mobile / 46px desktop. `text-section-head` now clamps exactly
   between those two, so the `lg:text-page-title` that used to supply the
   desktop end is gone — with the corrected token it would have capped the
   heading at 40px and made it SMALLER at large widths. */

            accessible name clean but still polluted textContent — so the h2
            extracted as "Start with the teachers01parents pick", which is what

                 `em` here resolves against the ordinal's own 11.5px font-size,
                 not the heading's, so the old offset was ~15px and dropped the
                 ordinal 9px into line 1 — it drew on top of the first line's
                 letters instead of sitting beside line 2. Line 2 is always the
                 last line, so measuring from the bottom centres it there at any
                 heading size. `pl-8` on line 2 keeps the gutter clear for it. */
