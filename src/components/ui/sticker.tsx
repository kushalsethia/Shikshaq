/* Redesign P8 (components.md §1, design.md §2.5).

   A tilted pill that overhangs the top-right of a block.

   NAME COLLISION — read before editing: index.css already defines a `.sticker`
   class, and it is something else entirely (a white + foreground double ring
   used by the device library). This component deliberately does NOT use that
   class. Reported in the Phase 0 audit; per handoff §7 the old class is not
   renamed.

   Placement rules:
   - top -10/-11px, right 12–18px, rotate ±4–6°, 10.5–11px/800
   - ONE per card, never more than a third of a grid, never on a result row
   - NEVER on a teacher card (design.md §2.5 concentric photo rule is binding:
     nothing overlaps a teacher's face)
   - The parent must not clip: put overflow:hidden on the photo block, not the
     card, or the overhang is cut off (design.md §8)
   - Decorative tilt only — the text inside is real text, and reduced motion
     flattens the rotation (design.md §3) */
