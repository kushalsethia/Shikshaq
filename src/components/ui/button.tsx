/* Redesign P1 (handoff components.md §1).
   The redesign adds six named variants — primary / indigo / whatsapp / muted /
   dark / ghost — and a 40/44/46/52/54px size ramp. The stock shadcn variants
   (default, destructive, outline, secondary, link) and sizes are KEPT: ~29 files
   still call them, and the handoff's rule is "design wins, keep functionality".
   New work should use the redesign variants; the shadcn ones are legacy.

   Heights come from components.md verbatim. 46/52/54 have no step on the spacing
   scale (44 = h-11, 48 = h-12), so they are arbitrary px. design.md §0.2 bans
   arbitrary *spacing* (`p-5`, `gap-7`, `[13px]` padding) — control height is a
   component dimension the spec fixes, not page rhythm. */
