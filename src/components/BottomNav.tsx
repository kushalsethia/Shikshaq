         scroll-lock setting `document.body.style.position = 'fixed'`, a
         plain z-index drop doesn't reliably keep this bar out of hit-testing
         (see the Navbar.tsx comment for the confirmed repro) — pointer-events
         is the part that actually stops a tap meant for the popup from
         quietly landing on "Past papers" underneath and navigating away. */
