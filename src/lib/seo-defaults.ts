/**
 * The one definition of what a page's meta tags fall back to.
 *
 * There were three, and they had already drifted: index.html, usePageMeta.ts
 * and SEOHead.tsx each hardcoded a different default description. That matters
 * more than it looks, because these are RESTORE values -- when a page unmounts
 * and the next route sets nothing of its own, whichever copy ran last decides
 * what the document says. Three copies meant the answer depended on which
 * component happened to unmount.
 *
 * DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION is index.html's wording verbatim, deliberately: that file
 * is the pre-JavaScript state of every route and the template
 * scripts/prerender.ts builds from, so it is the only copy a crawler can see
 * before React runs. Restoring to anything else would mean the document said
 * one thing on arrival and another after a client-side navigation back to a
 * page with no meta of its own.
 *
 * Keep this in sync with index.html by hand -- it cannot import from there.
