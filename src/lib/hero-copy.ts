/* Handoff H-005 — the home hero's copy resolver.
   One pure function, no new query: branches 1-2 read the useAuth() profile
   the page already holds, 3-5 read the intent store's lastSearch/lastTeacher/
   lastPaper records (src/lib/intent/store.ts) — the same single envelope
   TeacherProfile/PaperReader/SearchControl/the sentence builder/Browse all
   write into via recordSignal(), rather than three raw localStorage keys of
   its own. 6 is a session-stable random pool.

   Phase 2 of the intent index: this file used to read
   shikshaq.lastSearch/shikshaq.lastViewedTeacher/shikshaq.lastPaperSubject
   directly. Those are now sub-records of shikshaq.intent.v1 (still mirrored
   back to the old keys during the dual-write release), and reading the store
   module instead of the raw keys is what lets the hero and every later
   adaptive surface agree about who the visitor is, rather than each guessing
   from its own copy of the same three keys.

   ⚠ Branch 1b's copy calls for a gendered pronoun ("message her/him?") that
   the app has no reliable source for; "message them?" is used instead rather
   than guessing a gender. */
