/**
 * What the verify screen believes after an answer, as plain functions so the
 * rules are tested without a browser (nothing here touches React or Supabase).
 *
 *  1. Undo follows what the server took, not the buttons pressed. A refused
 *     verdict is taken off the list, and Undo stays off until a new answer is
 *     made, so it can never take back an answer the student did not just make.
 *     After a refresh the list is empty but the paper still shows how many are
 *     done, and the server allows Undo for 30 minutes, so that count lights it.
 *  2. Skipping the last open question. The papers list still says "skipped 0"
 *     until it is read again, so for that moment the screen must not say the
 *     paper is finished.
 *  3. Typed work that a refused verdict, or an answer from another tab, would
 *     otherwise take off the screen. It is shown again, for copying.
 *  4. Another tab of the same person answered the question this tab still shows.
