/**
 * Checker lanes: every flag the pipeline can put on a question, and the lane
 * that settles it, in plain English.
 *
 * The data below is a copy of the pipeline's lanes.json
 * (Shikshaq Papers/pipeline/auditor/pipeline/lanes.json, version 1), kept
 * as a committed JSON copy in src/content/checker-lanes.json. A test
 * (checker-lanes.test.ts) asserts this file matches that copy and that every
 * flag in it maps to a lane. To update: copy lanes.json over
 * src/content/checker-lanes.json, regenerate the tables below to match, and
 * the test says if they drifted.
 *
 * Owners:
 *   student_with_picture  a student settles it, looking at the page picture
 *   admin                 an admin settles it, a student is never asked
 *   ai_then_admin         the AI settles it; a student is never asked
 *
 * A code with no lane is NOT hidden: it renders the readableCode fallback and
 * unmappedCodes() reports it so a test (and a console warning) can see it.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no network.
