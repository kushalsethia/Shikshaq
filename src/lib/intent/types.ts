/* The intent index — the shapes.
 *
 * ShikshAQ already decided what to show a visitor in five unrelated places,
 * each reading raw storage on its own terms: hero-copy.ts had a six-branch
 * precedence chain, auth-intent.ts its own sessionStorage handoff, Browse its
 * FilterState, SearchControl a hardcoded suggestion map. None of them could
 * see each other, so the site could only ever replay whichever fragment
 * happened to fire first.
 *
 * This module is the one model they all read instead. It is deterministic,
 * synchronous, local, and pure: no request, no model call, nothing that can
 * block a render or fail. When it knows nothing it says so, and the caller
 * renders exactly what the site renders today.
 *
 * Two departures from the brief that shaped this file, both deliberate:
 *
 * 1. PROVENANCE PER SLOT, not one global confidence number. The app can be
 *    certain about subject (the reader picked it from a dropdown) while
 *    knowing nothing at all about area. A single `confidence: 0.87` averages
 *    that away and every downstream check has to guess what it covered.
 *    Per-slot provenance lets a guardrail say exactly what it means:
 *    "adapt the headline only when subject.source === 'explicit'".
 *
 * 2. NO `urgency` FIELD. The brief lists one; nothing in ShikshAQ observes it.
 *    Board season is a fact about the calendar, not a signal from the person
 *    reading. Scoring urgency from that would be the "confidently wrong"
 *    failure the brief warns about, dressed up as a number. Omitted rather
 *    than faked. `priceSensitivity` is binary for the same reason: a fee
 *    filter being touched is a fact, "medium sensitivity" is a guess.
