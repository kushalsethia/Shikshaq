/* The only write path into the intent store, and the journey state machine.
 *
 * Two rules hold this file together, and both are structural rather than
 * matters of discipline:
 *
 * 1. A WEAK SIGNAL CAN NEVER MOVE THE STAGE. Scroll depth, dwell time and
 *    hover are recorded so the debug panel can show them, and then weighted
 *    zero. Eight seconds on a section means the reader spent eight seconds
 *    there; it does not mean they are interested. `advanceStage` refuses to
 *    look at anything whose SIGNAL_STRENGTH is 'weak', so a future call site
 *    cannot accidentally promote one.
 *
 * 2. EXPLICIT BEATS DERIVED BEATS INFERRED. A slot is only overwritten by a
 *    source at least as strong as the one already there, unless the existing
 *    value has gone stale. So a subject read off a route never displaces a
 *    subject the reader picked from a dropdown.
 *
 * Regression is first class. Clearing filters steps the stage back, changing
 * subject replaces the slot and drops what depended on it, and navigating
 * backwards never overwrites anything.
