/**
 * The one place a paper's search title, description and heading are built.
 *
 * Two writers used to disagree: scripts/prerender.ts (what a crawler that does
 * not run JavaScript reads) and src/pages/BankPaper.tsx (what the browser sets
 * after load) each spelled their own template, and they had already drifted
 * apart (one said "Mathematics", the other "Maths"; the descriptions differed).
 * Both now call this, with the raw database row, so they cannot differ.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: no browser or Supabase imports, so the Node prerender can
 * load it.
 *
 * Wording rules, from the owner-approved SEO brief of 2026-09-30:
 * - Board and exam are part of what people search ("ICSE Class 10 Maths
 *   Pre-board 2025"), so they belong in the title.
 * - Never "PDF" and never "Solved": there is no download and there are no
 *   solutions, so either word would mislead.
 * - A part is left out when its field is empty, when exam is "Unknown", or when
 *   board is the generic placeholder "Board".
