   folded into the papers-surface `Paper` shape both pages use) is drawn on a
   PaperCover, and how a fixed number of slots (a home rail, "recently added")
   picks a set that doesn't read as ten copies of the same paper.

   Was two copies of coverPaper()/coverMeta() — PastPapers.tsx's original, and
   one duplicated into Index.tsx while that file was mid-edit by another
   agent. Consolidated here now that PastPapers.tsx is free, per product-owner
   review of the home shelf (2026-09-26): it also caught that the shelf, with
   no variety picker, was rendering ten near-identical "ICSE 2026 · Board · N
   questions" covers — the bank sorts undated/board papers first at the top
   of any given year, so a naive slice(0, 10) landed on ten of them. */
