-- ============================================================
-- 3. checker_next_question(): rewrite + skip-a-paper + English-never
-- ============================================================
-- Three changes on top of the hygiene migration's version:
--   (a) Speed: the per-candidate correlated "how many questions does this
--       paper still have open" subquery (H3: 36,061 buffers to serve one
--       row) is now computed once per DISTINCT candidate paper (candidates
--       CTE + paper_open_counts CTE), not once per candidate ROW.
--   (b) Skip jumps to another paper (owner decision, 2026-09-29): a paper
--       this checker skipped a question from in the last 30 minutes is
--       pushed behind every other paper in the ORDER BY -- but the skipped
--       QUESTION itself is not touched, and it is still served to any
--       OTHER checker immediately (only this checker's ordering changes).
--   (c) English is AI-only (owner): a row is never served here if its
--       paper's subject starts with "English" (any of the three English
--       subject labels) or its own source tag is the english_w14 pipeline.
--       90 open kid-queue rows are English today (see section 5 below);
--       none of them will be served by this function once applied.
--
-- Locking: the original did the ordering and the "for update skip locked"
-- row lock in one statement. Pushing the ordering into CTEs (needed for
-- (a)) means the winning row can no longer be locked in the same SELECT
-- (FOR UPDATE cannot target a CTE). Locking is now compare-and-swap: try
-- to claim the computed winner with an UPDATE ... WHERE <still available>,
-- and if another transaction claimed it in the tiny window between picking
-- and claiming, retry (excluding that id) up to 5 times. At the checker
-- concurrency this system actually has (single digits), this is
-- functionally equivalent to SKIP LOCKED and cannot livelock: each retry
-- permanently excludes the id that just lost the race.

-- 4. English rescue publish trigger: tighten the split-half path
-- ============================================================
-- H4 (stress test): the trigger's WHEN clause allows ANY split
-- (new.split_from_id is not null) to reach english_rescue_publish_split_half(),
-- not just an English-rescue split. Today that function itself refuses
-- anything whose PARENT isn't tagged english_w14/rescue, so nothing wrong
-- happens -- but the WHEN clause is broader than the one case the function
-- actually handles, so a future change to that function (or a new pipeline
-- reusing split_from_id) could publish a question outside the whole-paper
-- gate without the trigger itself ever refusing.
--
-- A trigger's WHEN clause cannot contain a subquery (Postgres restriction),
-- so the parent's tag cannot be checked there directly -- the WHEN clause
-- above stays as broad as it is today. Instead, the guard is duplicated
-- into the DISPATCHER (this function), which now re-verifies the parent's
-- tag itself before ever calling english_rescue_publish_split_half(), so
-- the gate holds even if that function's own internal guard is ever
-- loosened. Behaviour for a real English rescue split is unchanged: the
-- parent lookup here is exactly the same lookup that function already
-- does, so nothing that publishes today stops publishing.
