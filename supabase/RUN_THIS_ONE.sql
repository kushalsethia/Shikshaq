-- Shikshaq: every pending database change, in one file.
--
-- Paste the whole thing into the Supabase SQL editor and run it. It is
-- idempotent -- running it twice is harmless -- and it is wrapped so that if
-- any part fails, none of it applies.
--
-- There is NO staging database. Both deployments share uvtifolnsneitetzohtn,
-- so this is production the moment it runs. Prefer Kolkata off-hours.
-- The rollback for each section is written inline beside it.
--
-- WHAT IS IN HERE, in priority order:
--
--   1. SECURITY, URGENT. Two functions answer anonymous callers right now and
--      should not. One of them hands out 206 named children's profiles.
--   2. RETENTION. The 90-day purge exists but nothing has ever run it. The
--      privacy policy now states the 90 days, so it has to be true.
--   3. DIAGNOSTICS. Read-only checks for three things nobody has established:
--      whether ip_hash is real, whether the enumeration endpoints are inert,
--      and whether question_count matches reality.
--
-- Everything outside the database is already done and deployed.
-- =========================================================================


-- =========================================================================
-- SECTION 1 -- SECURITY. This is the urgent part.
-- =========================================================================
--
-- THE BUG. Migration 20260918100000 revoked its new functions `from public`,
-- following the pattern 20260818120000 established. That is not sufficient on
-- Supabase, and the ACLs say so plainly:
--
--   purge_read_events  postgres=X/postgres
--                      anon=X/postgres          <- a DIRECT grant
--                      authenticated=X/postgres
--
-- Supabase ships `alter default privileges in schema public grant execute on
-- functions to anon, authenticated`, so every newly created function is
-- granted EXECUTE BY ROLE NAME. Revoking from PUBLIC does not touch a direct
-- role grant. This is the exact inverse of the trap 20260818120000 documented:
-- both PUBLIC grants and direct role grants exist, so a function is only
-- closed when it is revoked from all three.
--
-- CONFIRMED EXPLOITABLE against production, as an anonymous caller holding
-- only the publishable key that ships in the JS bundle:
--
--   POST /rest/v1/rpc/purge_read_events      -> 200
--   POST /rest/v1/rpc/get_public_profile_data -> 200, 52,753 bytes, 206 rows
--
-- The second is the serious one: full_name, school_college, grade, role and
-- avatar_url for every profile, many of them school students, downloadable in
-- one request by anyone. It has NO call sites in src/ -- the app reads
-- commenter names through a join on teacher_comments.profiles. It is an
-- orphan, and closing it breaks nothing.
--
-- The first is an unauthenticated DELETE against the audit table. Bounded
-- today (it only removes rows older than 90 days, and the table is young) but
-- once read_events fills, anyone could trim the record of their own scraping.
--
-- admin_teacher_contacts() was NOT exploitable: it returned 42501 because its
-- in-body is_admin() check caught what the grant let through. That is the
-- argument for the two-layer pattern, demonstrated on live traffic.

-- --- Signed-in only ------------------------------------------------------

-- that they are not a teacher. Closed for tidiness, not urgency.

--                            policies; returns false to anon.
--   check_user_exists(text)  one call site, in the sign-in flow, which runs
--   check_user_has_password  BEFORE the user is authenticated -- so anon
--                            EXECUTE is required for sign-in to work.
-- Both are user-enumeration shaped. Section 3 establishes whether they are
-- inert or broken, which has to be known before they can be changed safely.

-- =========================================================================
-- SECTION 2 -- RETENTION THAT ACTUALLY RUNS
-- =========================================================================
--
-- read_events records which papers each account opens. Many of those account
-- holders are minors. A 90-day limit was written into purge_read_events() and
-- then nothing was ever scheduled to call it, so the real retention has been
-- "forever". The privacy policy now states 90 days plainly, so this has to be
-- true rather than aspirational.
--
-- TWO MECHANISMS, because the reliable one is not guaranteed to be available:
--
--   (a) pg_cron, if this project can enable it. Cleanest: runs at 03:00 daily
--       whether or not anyone visits the site.
--   (b) An INSERT trigger on read_events that purges at most once an hour.
--       Needs no scheduler and no extension. Its weakness is the mirror of
--       cron's strength -- it only runs when somebody reads something -- but
--       a table that nobody is writing to is also a table that is not growing,
--       so the case it misses is the case that does not matter.
--
-- Both are installed. Running both is harmless: whichever fires first finds
-- nothing left for the other to delete.

begin;

-- --- (b) the mechanism that needs nothing ---------------------------------

-- it survives restarts and is visible to anyone inspecting the schema.
