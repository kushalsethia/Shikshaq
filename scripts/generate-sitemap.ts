   ignores lastmod values it finds unreliable, so the signal was being spent

   and whose deploys are manual, which is exactly the situation the signal
   exists for. It also made the committed sitemap churn 3,660 lines on every
   build, which is noise in every diff and a hazard around `git add -A`.

   Now each entity page carries its row's own date. Neither table has an
   `updated_at`, so this is `created_at`: right for the many pages that have
   not changed since import, and understating for a teacher who later edits
   their profile. Understating is the safer error -- a date that is wrong in
   one direction for a few rows still leaves the field trustworthy, whereas
   "everything changed today" makes it worthless for all of them. Adding a real
