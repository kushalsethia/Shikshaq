/* The question bank's SOURCE shape — IMPORT TIME ONLY.
 *
 * data/question-bank.json is the extraction output: one flat array of
 * questions, each carrying its paper's school/year/exam/class alongside its
 * own text. That shape is how the bank arrives, not how the app reads it.
 * The app reads bank_papers and bank_questions from Supabase, where the paper
 * facts have been lifted into their own row.
 *
 * This file used to live in src/lib/question-bank.ts, which meant every
 * visitor's browser downloaded the grouping logic for a file no browser
 * fetches any more. It runs here instead, once, at import time.
 *
 * ⚠ Question text is passed through untouched. Nothing here rewrites it.
