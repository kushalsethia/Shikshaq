/**
 * Shrink the paper figures that are actually too big, in place.
 *
 * RUN THIS LOCALLY, NEVER IN THE BUILD. It is deliberately not wired into
 * prebuild or postbuild. sharp is a native dependency, and a native dependency
 * that fails to install on Vercel produces a failed deploy that nobody here can
 * diagnose, because the live build logs are not readable from this team. The
 * figures are committed assets, so resizing them once and committing the result
 * gets the same bytes to the reader with none of that risk. Re-run it after
 * importing a new batch of papers.
 *
 *   npm install -D sharp --no-save                   # not a project dependency
 *   npx tsx scripts/resize-paper-figures.ts          # report only
 *   npx tsx scripts/resize-paper-figures.ts --write  # rewrite the files
 *
 * SHARP IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN package.json. Vercel runs `npm install`
 * including devDependencies -- vite and typescript are devDependencies here,
 * so it has to -- which means a `devDependencies: { sharp }` entry would put a
 * native build into the deploy path of a site whose build logs nobody on this
 * team can read. The script is worth keeping; the dependency is not. Install it
 * when you need it, run this, and let it go.
 *
 * WHY IT ONLY TOUCHES A FEW FILES. The headline number was "25 MB across 1,023
 * figures", which sounds like a library-wide problem and is not one. A reader
 * opens ONE paper, and the median paper carries 58 kB of figures. The real
 * finding is the distribution: one paper ships 4.3 MB on its own, a fifth of
 * the whole directory, because 21 of its figures are 250-312 kB scans.
 *
 * So this processes only files above THRESHOLD_KB. Measured across the whole
 * directory: touching 87 files captures 20% of the total bytes, while touching
 * all 1,023 captures 25%. The extra 5% costs a lossy re-encode of 936 images
 * that are already small and already fine, and every lossy re-encode throws
 * away a little more of a diagram a student is trying to read. Not worth it.
 *
 * WHY 600px TALL. The reader renders figures at `max-h-[300px]`, so 600 is two
 * device pixels per CSS pixel -- sharp on a retina phone, and nothing beyond
 * that reaches the eye. Width needs no cap: the extraction pipeline already
 * caps it at 900px.
 *
 * WHY NOT LOSSLESS. Tried it. These are photographic scans of exam papers, not
 * line art, and lossless WebP made the largest file BIGGER (312 kB -> 345 kB).
 *
 * AFTER RUNNING THIS, REGENERATE THE DIMENSIONS:
 *   npm run generate-figure-dimensions
 * src/content/figure-dimensions.ts stores each figure's intrinsic size so the
 * reader can reserve correctly shaped space before the bytes arrive. Resizing
 * without regenerating leaves those numbers describing images that no longer
 * exist, and the layout shift they were written to prevent comes straight back.
