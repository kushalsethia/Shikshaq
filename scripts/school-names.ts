/* School name resolution — IMPORT TIME ONLY.
 *
 * This used to live in src/lib and ship to every visitor: a strip regex, an
 * alias map and ~30 unresolved abbreviations, downloaded by every browser so
 * it could re-derive the same school name on every page load, for data that
 * cannot change between deploys. It also meant correcting a school's name was
 * a code change and a deploy.
 *
 * Now it runs once, in scripts/import-bank.ts, and the resolved name is
 * written to bank_papers.school. The app reads that column. Renaming a school
 * is an UPDATE. None of this is in the client bundle any more.
 *
 * The bank's `school` field is derived from source filenames, so it arrives
 * abbreviated with paper-code fragments attached ("Avm Juhu Icse10 Preprelim",
 * "Cnms Mpe"). Two passes fix what can be fixed honestly:
 *
 *   1. strip the code fragments — filename residue, not part of a name
 *   2. expand only schools that are unambiguous, each one verified against
 *      the school's own site or its CISCE listing before being added
 *
 * Anything not in the map is left as the source had it, cleaned but not
 * invented. A wrong school name on a question paper is worse than a terse one,
 * so nothing here is a guess — see UNRESOLVED_SCHOOLS for what was deliberately
 * left alone.
 *
 * ⚠ Display only. The bank's own question data is never rewritten.
 */

/* Paper-code fragments that are filename residue rather than name.
 *
 * Four of these earned their place by splitting one school into several:
 *   `prelims?\d*`   "Children'S Academy Prelim01" kept the 01, because \b sits
 *                   between two word characters and so never matched
 *   `xii|xi|x|...`  a trailing class numeral: "Ariv X ...", "... Pfe Ii".
 *                   Longest-first, or `x` would match the front of `xii`
 *   `\d{1,4}`       a bare trailing digit, which made "Avm" and "Avm 6" two
 *                   different schools with one paper each
 *   `rehearsal`     this source's word for a mock ("Cbs Rehearsal X Maths")
